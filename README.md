## üíª How to Add to OBS Studio (or other Broadcast Software)

Follow these steps to integrate the widget into your streaming setup:

1.  **Open OBS Studio.**
2.  In the "Sources" dock, click the `+` button to add a new source.
3.  Select **`Browser`**.
4.  Give your new source a descriptive name (e.g., "Stream Date/Time"). Click "OK".
5.  In the properties window that appears:
    * **Crucially:** Ensure the **"Local file"** checkbox is **UNCHECKED**.
    * In the **"URL"** field, paste the public browser link for your widget:
        `(https://batz736.github.io/Custom-Time-Widget/widget.html)`
    * Set the **Width** and **Height** of the Browser Source. A good starting point is `400` for Width and `150` for Height, but you can adjust this to fit your stream layout.
    * *(Optional but Recommended):* Check "Shutdown source when not active" and "Refresh browser when scene becomes active" for optimal performance.
    * Click "OK".

## üõ†Ô∏è Customize Your Widget

The widget features an integrated settings panel accessible directly from the Browser Source.

1.  In OBS Studio, right-click on your new "Stream Date/Time" (or whatever you named it) source in the "Sources" dock.
2.  Select **"Interact"**.
3.  A new window will open showing your widget. **Hover your mouse over the widget within this window** to make the "‚öôÔ∏è Settings" button appear in the top-right corner.
4.  Click the "‚öôÔ∏è Settings" button to open the customization panel.
5.  Adjust the various settings for font, size, colors, widget dimensions, background opacity, and time zone.
6.  Click **"Save Settings"** to apply your changes.
7.  Click **"Close"** to dismiss the settings panel.

## üé® Transparency

The widget is designed for seamless overlaying.
* The area *around* the widget is fully transparent by default.
* The widget's own background (the colored rectangle) has an adjustable opacity. To make the widget's background completely invisible (showing only the text), set the "Background Opacity" slider to `0` in the settings panel.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Settings Are Saved

Your custom settings are stored locally in your browser's `localStorage` (or OBS's internal browser cache for that specific source URL). This means your personalized settings will persist even if you close and reopen OBS or your browser.

## üåê Fonts
