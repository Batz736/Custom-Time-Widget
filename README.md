## üíª How to Add to OBS Studio (or other Broadcast Software)

Follow these steps to integrate the widget into your streaming setup:

1.  **Open OBS Studio.**
2.  In the "Sources" dock, click the `+` button to add a new source.
3.  Select **`Browser`**.
4.  Give your new source a descriptive name (e.g., "Stream Date/Time"). Click "OK".
5.  In the properties window that appears:
    * **Crucially:** Ensure the **"Local file"** checkbox is **UNCHECKED**.
    * In the **"URL"** field, paste the public browser link for your widget:
        `(https://batz736.github.io/Custom-Time-Widget)`
    * Set the **Width** and **Height** of the Browser Source. A good starting point is `400` for Width and `150` for Height, but you can adjust this to fit your stream layout.
    * *(Optional but Recommended):* Check "Shutdown source when not active" and "Refresh browser when scene becomes active" for optimal performance.
    * Click "OK".
